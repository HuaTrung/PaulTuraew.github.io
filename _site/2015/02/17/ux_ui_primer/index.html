      <h2>UX/UI 101</h2>
      <p class="muted">February 17, 2015</p>

      <p>In my time since graduating <em>GA's Web Development Immersive</em>, I have been doing a lot of indulging. Specifically, I have allowed myself to spend time read what I want online. (I actually gave myself formal permission on a sticky note, signed and dated, stuck to my desk near my computer as solemn reminder to never forget to have fun).</p>

<p>While many people tend to value backend developers for their "problem solving" prowess, there is equally crucial and difficult problem solving to be done on the frontend - <strong>user engagement</strong>!</p>

<p>After giving an Unconference talk on cognitive science and the search for AI, trust me when I say: all the brilliant, backend bunker-busting code would mean little to nothing without effective presentation to the target audience.</p>

<p>In order to make an effective presentation to the target audience, a frontend dev must know how the audience thinks and this is no easy task. It is not easy because no two people will think exactly the same about your product. That said, there are some 101-level rules that are good to keep in mind:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Focus on the <em>experience</em>. Text, graphics and layout should make sense to the product and should work together to tell a story.</p></li>
<li><p>People don't read websites. They scan them. Provide users with ability to make easy judgment calls on what is valuable and what is not.</p></li>
<li><p>Always strive for <em>simplicity and clarity</em>. A user can decide in less than half a second whether your site is something they are interested in spending time on. Make sure they do not have to think about or guess what you want them to know.</p></li>
<li><p>Creativity and new tech should be used smartly. When users expect to see left and right arrows because they want to go to the next or previous page but instead see blinking, different color lights, they get confused. No one has a good time.</p></li>
<li><p>Capture attention above the fold but don't sacrifice content for the fold.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't forget, there is a difference between a "responsive design" and a "nice, responsive design." (I'm still working on implementing this one.)</p></li>
</ol>


<p>But these rules (or at least their spirit) do not only apply to frontend devs. These days, simple and easy to understand backend code is highly coveted. Why? Because it makes sense on all levels: it helps the business keep legacy code manageable, prevents errors and promotes faster and more efficient deployment.</p>

<p>By indulging in my curiosity, I have come to greatly appreciate the need for full stack, frontend and backend devs to be highly cognizant of others' perceptions and learning styles. Form and function are one.</p>
