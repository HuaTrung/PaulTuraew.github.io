      <h2>What is Responsive Design?</h2>
      <p class="muted">January 05, 2015</p>

      <p>My first iteration of <em>turaew.io</em> proved successful but when I shared the site with my wife, she could not get past how horrible it looked on her mobile phone.</p>

<p>I intended for her to view it on her laptop but she insisted on checking it out on her phone (no doubt fueled by my request to use a laptop).</p>

<p>I was not going to make my site public until I had some responsiveness but my wife's reaction underlined the importance of this task.</p>

<p>Learning to apply Bootstrap I also wanted to know a little bit more about how responsive design came about.</p>

<p>Responsive design was primarily and initially written on extensively by Ethan Marcotte in 2010. Marcotte said that responsive design has three main tenants:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fluid grids,</li>
<li>Flexible images, and</li>
<li>Media queries.</li>
</ol>


<p>A fluid grid is one that's built using a relative unit of measurement like ems or percent instead of pixels.</p>

<p>Flexible image means that the images resize as part of the design, they generally display larger on a big-screen, and they scale down as the size reduces.</p>

<p>Media queries allow you to define different styles for different screen widths.</p>

<p>Prior to the creation of responsive design there was adaptive layout which was written about by Marc den Dobbelsteen.</p>

<p>Adaptive design uses a fixed width grid system in which a screen will resize once specific widths are reached. One major distinction seems to be that adaptive design will not always fill up an entire screen the way a fully-responsive design does.</p>
