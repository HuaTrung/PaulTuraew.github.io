      <h2>RedMonk Programming Language Rankings</h2>
      <p class="muted">January 20, 2015</p>

      <p>Just released is the RedMonk Programming Language Rankings for Q1 2015, you can find a link <a href="http://redmonk.com/sogrady/2015/01/14/language-rankings-1-15/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Very interesting to note the methodology to calculate the ratings:</p>

<p><em>- To be included in this analysis, a language must be observable within both GitHub and Stack Overflow.</em></p>

<p><em>- No claims are made here that these rankings are representative of general usage more broadly. They are nothing more or less than an examination of the correlation between two populations we believe to be predictive of future use, hence their value.</em></p>

<p><em>- There are many potential communities that could be surveyed for this analysis. GitHub and Stack Overflow are used here first because of their size and second because of their public exposure of the data necessary for the analysis. We encourage, however, interested parties to perform their own analyses using other sources.</em></p>

<p><em>- All numerical rankings should be taken with a grain of salt. We rank by numbers here strictly for the sake of interest. In general, the numerical ranking is substantially less relevant than the languageâ€™s tier or grouping.</em></p>

<p><em>- In many cases, one spot on the list is not distinguishable from the next. The separation between language tiers on the plot, however, is generally representative of substantial differences in relative popularity.</em></p>

<p><em>- GitHub language rankings are based on raw lines of code, which means that repositories written in a given language that include a greater number amount of code in a second language (e.g. JavaScript) will be read as the latter rather than the former.</em></p>

<p><em>- In addition, the further down the rankings one goes, the less data available to rank languages by. Beyond the top tiers of languages, depending on the snapshot, the amount of data to assess is minute, and the actual placement of languages becomes less reliable the further down the list one proceeds.</em></p>
