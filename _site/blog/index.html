    <h5>November 30, 2014</h5>
    <!-- <p>---title: Why I Bloglayout: post---Before creating this site, I agonized on whether to write a blog. I always liked the idea of a blog but did not think I would make a good blogger for two primary reasons:1. I did not think I could muster the fortitude to share my thoughts and endeavors publically (I rarely share on facebook and a retweet is hardly original thought); and2. I am my own worst critic and knew that if my writing was not exactly as I thought it <em>should</em> be, I would not write as often or at all.I am trying to overcome these excuses:1. I heard someone on a podcast mention that they use their blog as a reference for themselves - a way to catalog their thoughts, mistakes and successes. I loved this idea and believe it can help me deal with the vulnerability that comes with putting your thoughts into the public sphere.2. I am giving myself license to not be <em>perfect</em> in my writing. I will write what I want and how I want and I will welcome the opportunity to be wrong.Almost finished with my three-month full stack web development immersive program at General Assembly, I have learned much (in fact, I do not remember a three month time period when I learned more new things in my life). My brain is feels full and I need a release (that is not inundated with semicolons, brackets or periods after every other word).</p>
