        <p>Before creating this site, I agonized on whether to write a blog. I always liked the idea of a blog but did not think I would make a good blogger for two primary reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I did not think I could muster the fortitude to share my thoughts and endeavors publicly (I rarely share on facebook and a retweet is hardly original thought); and</p></li>
<li><p>I am my own worst critic and knew that if my writing was not exactly as I thought it should be, I would not write as often or at all.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>I try to address and overcome these excuses in the following ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I heard someone on a podcast mention that they use their blog as a reference for themselves - a way to catalog their thoughts, mistakes and successes. I loved this idea and believe it can help me deal with the vulnerability that comes with putting your thoughts into the public sphere.</p></li>
<li><p>I am giving myself license to not be perfect in my writing. I will write what I want and how I want and I will welcome the opportunity to be wrong.Almost finished with my three-month full stack web development immersive program at General Assembly, I have learned much (in fact, I do not remember a three month time period when I learned more new things in my life). My brain is feels full and I need a release (that is not inundated with semicolons, brackets or periods after every other word).</p></li>
</ol>
