title: Why Jekyll
---

I found there are a lot of options for starting a blog online. Wordpress and Ghost and a new one called Jekyll.

After doing some research I found that a static site generator like Jekyll offers some advantages over dynamic sites like Wordpress:
1.	Site operates faster (no trips to a database for info);
2.	Easy to deploy (no need to hook up a database); and
3.	Ownership and ease of transportability of content (markdown files are simple and easy to create and share).
The most important consideration for me was the third point: I really liked the idea of being able to craft blog posts easily in markdown and maintaining total ownership of them. It seemed like the developer thing to do.
