title: Balance - Personal and of Stones
---

This post is not about programming, it's purpose is to add a little substance to this site's cover photo and share a little bit about myself.

Not too long ago, I came across a professional photographer who practiced the Zen art of stone balancing. Check his work out [here](http://www.gravityglue.com/category/stone-balance/). The photos drew me in. I overcame any shyness I had about going out to my local trail, getting into the stream and started stacking rocks. 

I do not practice Zen anything but I am a fan of anything that can create "flow" so effortlessly within me. 

This site's cover photo was taken by me one day when I went to balance stones with the intent of also practicing my macro photography with the help of President Business. I thought minifig's facial expression made for the perfect emotional contrast to what I was doing in the real world.

Here are some additional photos from that afternoon:
