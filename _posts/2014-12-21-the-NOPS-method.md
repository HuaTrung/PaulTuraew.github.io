title: The NOPS Method
---

I will freely admit that when faced with the task of learning some new programming framework or language, I am filled with a mixture of excitement and anxiety.

I have determined through much introspection that both of these emotions when delivered in medium to high doses can inhibit one's ability to learn.

Then I learned about the **NOPS method** through a Ruby Rogues podcast:

The NOPS method can help increase ability to focus and remain in the 'discomfort zone' :

**N**otice it: be aware and identify the issue of discomfort( i.e. what are you struggling with specifically?)

**O**wn it: 'I am uncomfortable with this and don't understand' (relieve anxiety)

**P**ush into it: approach the source of discomfort directly to increase discomfort and attempt to grasp it (partial desensitization, part learning)

**S**tay with it: continue to struggle with it. discipline to continue the effort.
