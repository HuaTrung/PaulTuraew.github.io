title: Meetups for Introverts
---

I am a functional introvert who has learned to loath small talk.

However, breaking into a completely new professional field requires the thing most introverts dread: networking.

Listening to a Code Newbies podcast, I came across a very small but helpful peice of advice I would like to share: three simply questions you can tuck away into long-term memory and call upon whenever your in a room filled with strangers:

1. How did you learn to code?

2. What tech or challenges are you excited about?

3. What projects u working on?
