title: Cognitive Science and AI
---

Last Tuesday, I gave a talk at General Assembly DC's first *New Tech UnConference* on Cognitive Science.

I originally wanted to give a presentation on artificial intellegence and programming but after some research decided I could give a more effective talk by introducing the concepts behind cognitive science and then linking them to challenges faced by AI researchers.
