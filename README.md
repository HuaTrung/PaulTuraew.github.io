### Overview/Background

As I enjoy writing I wanted to incorporate blog functionality into my personal website. I decided to try using Jekyll. As Jekyll comes with Bootstrap, I was excited to play with this as well.

This site therefore is my first attempt at building a personal site using Jekyll and Bootstrap. I want there to be only two pages: a main page covering about me, sample projects (AKA my portfolio) and my contact info. The second page should be separate and contain my blog posts chronologically ordered.
